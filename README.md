# Where am I?
### BY: Noah, Arun, Chuksi, Josh and Giovanni.

This is a city identifier project we created for our CS121 class software development class. We built an app that is able to identify which city you give it. So you select and upload an image and it would tell you where that image is. It identifies these cities based on whether it's a skyline image or city landmark. 

Currently, it can only identify between 5 cities. The 5 cities are New York, London, New Delhi, Tokyo and San Francisco. All of our models operate at a 75% or greater accuracy. All a user needs to do to use our application is upload a .jpg, .jpeg or .png image of a city landmark or skyline and press the predict button!

Our project was created using a fastai model deployed via Flask and Google Cloud Platform.
